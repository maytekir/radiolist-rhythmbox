Radio channel entries for Rhythmbox player.

This is an online radio stations entry list with all SomaFM stations and some Turkish radio stations based on my personal taste for Rhythmbox player which i made it for my personal use.

There are two seperate entry list files; one with SomaFM stations only and the other one is the Turkish stations.

Simply copy and paste the entries into your  *~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml*  file to add the stations and restart Rhythmbox.
